                The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that
                will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and
                consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in
                the development of leading-edge AI technology. In this
                Specialization, you will build and train neural network
                architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent
                Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them
                better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He
                initialization, and more. Get ready to master theoretical
                concepts and their industry applications using Python and
                TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech
                recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation,
                natural language processing, and more. AI is transforming many
                industries. The Deep Learning Specialization provides a pathway
                for you to take the definitive step in the world of AI by
                helping you gain the knowledge and skills to level up your
                career. Along the way, you will also get career advice from deep
                learning experts from industry and academia.
